## ALXS aniMulti AJAX jQuery plugin

###  Introduction

This plugin was created to be a one-stop multi-purpose tool for developers wishing to create beautiful, quick AJAX websites, whilst implementing various different content transitions and animations.

The idea behind this project came from the use of some excellent plugins created by [Alvaro Trigo](https://www.http://alvarotrigo.com/), so make sure you check out his work as well. For those not wishing to use AJAX, you would be better off using his standalone plugins - [fullPage](http://www.alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/), [pagePiling](http://www.alvarotrigo.com/pagePiling/) and [multiScroll](http://www.alvarotrigo.com/multiScroll/). Whilst keeping the basic idea behind these plugins, the idea has been enhanced to include AJAX loading with full customisation of transition types, speeds, tags and links. 

This plugin also contains built in navigation and footer, both of which include branding functionality, multiple color themes including flat colors and also gradients. These can be enabled or disabled individually, depending on your need.

The main advantages in using this plugin is that the amount of content you have is not as limited and the SEO of your site SHOULD be much better.
